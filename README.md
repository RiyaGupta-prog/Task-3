Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts house prices based on various features using a Linear Regression model in Python.

📁 Dataset

File: Housing.csv

Target Variable: price

Features:

area (in sq.ft)

bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking

Binary categorical: mainroad, guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, prefarea

Multi-class categorical: furnishingstatus



✅ Steps Covered

1. Data Preprocessing

Converted binary categorical variables (yes/no) to 1/0.

One-hot encoded the furnishingstatus column.

Checked for and handled missing values.


2. Train-Test Split

Used train_test_split() to split the dataset (80% train, 20% test).


3. Model Training

Applied Linear Regression using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression().


4. Evaluation Metrics

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score


5. Coefficient Analysis

Extracted and displayed model coefficients to understand feature importance.


6. Visualization

Plotted regression line for area vs price to visualize prediction fit.


📦 Requirements

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

🚀 How to Run

python housing_price_prediction.py

Or use a Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab for step-by-step execution and visual output.

📌 Notes

Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between independent variables and the target.

You can experiment with Polynomial Regression or feature scaling to enhance results.
